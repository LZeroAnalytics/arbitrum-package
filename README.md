# Arbitrum package

This is a [Kurtosis][kurtosis-repo] package developed by [LZero](https://www.lzeroanalytics.com) that will spin up a private Arbitrum L2 / L3 over Docker or Kubernetes. Kurtosis packages are entirely reproducible and composable, so this will work the same way over Docker or Kubernetes, in the cloud or locally on your machine.

You now have the ability to spin up a private [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) testnet or public devnet/testnet with a single command. This package is designed to be used for testing, validation, and development, and is not intended for production use.


## Quickstart


1. [Install Docker & start the Docker Daemon if you haven't done so already][docker-installation]
2. [Install the Kurtosis CLI, or upgrade it to the latest version if it's already installed][kurtosis-cli-installation]
3. Run the package with default configurations from the command line:

   ```bash
   kurtosis run --enclave my-testnet github.com/LZeroAnalytics/arbitrum-package
   ```

This command will spin up a minimal Ethereum network, deploy the Arbitrum contracts, and spin up a sequencer and batch poster.
#### Run with your own configuration

Kurtosis packages are parameterizable, meaning you can customize your network and its behavior to suit your needs by storing parameters in a file that you can pass in at runtime like so:

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave my-testnet github.com/LZeroAnalytics/arbitrum-package --args-file network_params.yaml
```

Where `network_params.yaml` contains the parameters for your network in your current directory.

#### Run on Kubernetes

Kurtosis packages work the same way over Docker or on Kubernetes. Please visit the [Kubernetes docs](https://docs.kurtosis.com/k8s) to learn how to spin up a private testnet on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Management

The [Kurtosis CLI](https://docs.kurtosis.com/cli) can be used to inspect and interact with the network.

For example, if you need shell access, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis service shell my-testnet $SERVICE_NAME
```

And if you need the logs for a service, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis service logs my-testnet $SERVICE_NAME
```

To stop a network run:

```bash
kurtosis enclave stop $THE_NETWORK_NAME
```

Before running a new network with the same network name, you should remove all associated resources:

```bash
kurtosis enclave rm $THE_NETWORK_NAME
```

You can also pass the ``-f`` flag to stop a network and remove resources in one command.

An easy way to clean all unused resources and shut down all networks:

```bash
kurtosis clean -a
```

## Debugging

To grab any files generated by the package, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis files download my-testnet $FILE_NAME $OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

For example, to retrieve the genesis file, run:

```bash
kurtosis files download my-testnet genesis-file ~/Downloads
```
